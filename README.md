# RayLib-Some-Graphics-demo-for-testing

This was a simple demo created to try out the Raylib 2D graphics, before I start spending more time in this library.

TBH I did not use the best tricks in the book to produce this small demo, it is a quick and dirty way of showing purdy graphics and animations, that I do not recommend doing as it is not aimed at best practice or most efficiency.

Also to be noted is all of the assets used located in the data file are from other RayLib public demos, so not created by me.

Again, this was a quick and dirty demo in RayLibn, for what it's worth.

Also note that to exit the demo,, you will need to figure out the key combination, or to comment out SetExitKey(NULL)
